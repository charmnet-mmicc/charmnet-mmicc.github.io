A variational multiscale (VMS) stabilized FE method with highly scalable multilevel block-preconditioning techniques have been used to perform the simulation in ITER geometry (3D). An initial mesh of about 125K elements and one million unknowns have been used for an initial study. The VDE simulation is started with MHD equilibrium obtained from a Grad-Shafranov solver using real case ITER configuration. An artificial cooling term has been added to model the temperature quench in a disruption. The solver is able to cope with very large velocities triggered by the sudden loss of temperature, as well as the density perturbations. An initial assessment of wall forces and temperatures can be done from the computed wall currents.

Scaling of Multilevel Preconditioners for resistive MHD based on multiphysics block preconditioning (preliminary results) Peter Ohm (SNL), John Shadid (SNL), Edward Phillips (SNL), Ray Tuminaro (SNL),Jonathan Hu (SNL), Jesus Bonilla (LANL), Michael Crockatt (SNL) A critical component of implicit or IMEX MHD simulations of complex multiphysics systems is the development of scalable preconditioners. In this context there are two significant issues that must be addressed for implicit solution of these systems. These are the ill-conditioning of the linear systems that occurs due to the existence of elliptic type operators related to diffusion type process, and hyperbolic type operators that are often generated from off-diagonal cross-coupled transport mechanisms. To handle the elliptic type ill-conditioning optimal scalable multilevel methods are employed. For the cross-coupled multiphysics hyperbolic interactions physics-based (PB) / approximate block preconditioning (ABF) preconditioning approaches are used. These PB/ABF methods reduce the implicit solve for the complex coupled multifluid system into a set of sub-systems that segregate the physics (in the preconditioner only) for which we have demonstrated the use of scalable algebraic multilevel solvers. General details of these approaches can be found in VMS Incompressible MHD , Fully-coupled AMG Resistive MHD , ABF 2D Reduced MHD , Teko PB/ABF Preconditioning Package . As an initial demonstration of the effectiveness of the PB/ABF approach to deal withe the off-diagonal coupling of the Alfven wave we show the solution statistics for increasing Alfven wave CFLs for a preliminary ITER VDE computational after a thermal quench. The table presents the number of time steps (nT), the average number of nonlinear Newton steps per time step (nL/nT), the average number of linear iterations per non-linear step (l,nL) and the average time per time step (t/nT) excluding IO. These preliminary results indicates that the proposed PB/ABF method has excellent algorithmic and time per time step scaling for increasing Alfven wave CFLs.

The model is based on a five moment multifluid model. A specific capability goal is a flexible and extensible capability for modeling complex multiphysics plasmas in the context of proposed tokamak disruption mitigation strategies. The most general multifluid electromagnetic plasma model considered in this project is presented below. This system has a hyperbolic transport/wave physics system sub-structure (Euler-Maxwell) with strong EM, collisional, and ionization/recombination source term coupling, along with the inclusion of 2nd order diffusion type operators (most notably heat transfer). To make this ambitious approach to employing scalable multifluid EM plasma models tractable for TDS, we are building on recent unique algorithmic, and plasma-model developments by our team in the Drekar R&D MHD and multi-fluid/EM code as a software-base. The overall structure of this model is given below. *Five moment general multifluid model for atomic species s with collisional, ionization and recombination terms included and coupled to a full electromagnetic Maxwell system. This model is implemented within the Drekar multiphysics code. Drekar is an implicit/explicit (IMEX) scalable parallel unstructured FE code that employs algebraic flux corrected stabilization methods for handling unresolved gradients and strong shock discontinuities. An illustration of a Two-dimensional diocotron instability \u2013 Analytic growth rate comparison Michael Crockatt(SNL), John Shadid(SNL) Diocotron instabilities 1 2 3 , which are driven by velocity shear in non-neutral electron columns, have been studied experimentally and computationally in beam and cylindrical geometries. We consider a configuration consisting of a cylindrical electron beam inside a uniform axial magnetic field. In this case, a rotational velocity is produced in the plasma column due to $E\\times B$ forces exerted on the electron fluid. A suficiently strong shear in this rotational velocity drives the development of the cylindrical diocotron instability. Because the development of the instability is dominated by $E\\times B$ forces, the electric drift approximation is often used to reduce the electron velocity equation to that of a guiding center model, which removes the cyclotron motion of the particles.

Multifluid growth rate vs mesh resolution Generalized Ohm's law without electron inertia Scalable multilfuid EM solvers based on multiphysics block preconditioning John Shadid (SNL), Edward Phillips (SNL) A critical component of simulating large-scale multifluid systems is our physics-based (PB) / approximate block preconditioning (ABF) preconditioning approaches for complex multiphysics, these methods reduce the implicit solve for the complex coupled multifluid system into a set of sub-systems that segregate the physics (in the preconditioner only) for which we have demonstrated the use of scalable algebraic multilevel solvers. As a demonstration of the scalability of our multifluid simulation capabilities we present an example weak scaling study. This example is for a fully-ionized ion/electron high density/pressure core expanding into a magnetized background ion/electron plasma and the simulations were run on the LANL Trinity machine on > 16,000 cores. Illustration of weak scaling for implicit fully-ionized multifluid plasma model (electrons, ions) for the simulation of an 3D high density/pressure cloud expanding in a lower density background plasma with anisotropic expansion due to the presence of a magnetic field. Multiphysics block preconditioning methods are used to provide a scalable solution in parallel on the Los Alamos Trinity machine. The physics simulation goal is to understand impurity penetration and assimilation into plasmas for proposed disruption mitigation techniques. These techniques currently include massive gas injection and frozen pellet injection. To computationally simulate the proposed type of problems requires robust, accurate and scalable plasma modeling capabilities. We have completed an initial development of a general capability for partially-ionized plasmas composed of multiple atomic species with strongly driven multidimensional hydrodynamic transport processes, collisional, ionization and recombination interactions, and strong coupling to electric and magnetic fields. Neutral cloud expansion in a core region Here we first present an idealization of the process of introducing a high-density neutral species into the core region of a Deuterium plasma at conditions that are representative of Tokamak devices. In this case a 1D simulation is present and the transport is taken to be parallel to the magnetic field direction. Schematic diagram of an idealized insertion of a neutral cloud in the core region for disruption mitigation. Inside the separatrix a high density neutral cloud of Ar ionizes as it expands into a hot (10keV) Deuterium plasma environment. Comparison of expansion of (He, Ne, Ar) neutral cloud in the core region for disruption mitigation at 2.5 micro-seconds. Inside the separatrix the high density neutral cloud ionizes as it expands into a hot (10keV) Deuterium plasma environment. The simulation tracks up to 10 species Deuterium neutral and ion, electrons and the neutral and up to 6 charge states of the inserted species. Massive gas injection Next, we present an idealization of the process of injecting a high-density neutral species from the Tokamak wall into the core region. The jet first expands in the fill tube region, the propagates through a low-density edge/vacuum region, then impacts a static Deuterium plasma core at conditions that are representative of Tokamak devices. In this case a 1D simulation is present and the transport is taken to be perpendicular to the magnetic field direction.

Illustration of weak scaling for implicit fully-ionized multifluid plasma model (electrons, ions) for the simulation of an 3D high density/pressure cloud expanding in a lower density background plasma with anisotropic expansion due to the presence of a magnetic field. Multiphysics block preconditioning methods are used to provide a scalable solution in parallel on the Los Alamos Trinity machine. The physics simulation goal is to understand impurity penetration and assimilation into plasmas for proposed disruption mitigation techniques. These techniques currently include massive gas injection and frozen pellet injection. To computationally simulate the proposed type of problems requires robust, accurate and scalable plasma modeling capabilities. We have completed an initial development of a general capability for partially-ionized plasmas composed of multiple atomic species with strongly driven multidimensional hydrodynamic transport processes, collisional, ionization and recombination interactions, and strong coupling to electric and magnetic fields.", "title": "Scalable multilfuid EM solvers based on multiphysics block preconditioning"}, {"location": "drekar/#neutral-cloud-expansion-in-a-core-region", "text": "Here we first present an idealization of the process of introducing a high-density neutral species into the core region of a Deuterium plasma at conditions that are representative of Tokamak devices.

Runaway electrons in MFE Runaway electrons (RE) form as the plasma in a tokamak cools during the thermal quench stage in a disruption due to enhanced plasma resistivity and the corresponding increase of the induced loop voltage. Once they break free from collisional drag, REs become fundamentally kinetic since they cannot be controlled by self-collisional processes. As they accelerate, REs may pick up an increasing fraction of the plasma current, affecting magnetic field evolution. REs are confined by nested flux surfaces in a tokamak and can accelerate to sufficiently large energies to eventually rupture the vacuum wall, which is a key obstacle for the prospects of MFE as an energy source. Understanding RE generation and dynamics is a phenomenal applied mathematics challenge, in principle requiring the integration of the high-dimensional relativistic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation over magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) timescales (much longer than electron collision and transit times). The ultimate goal is to understand magnetic field evolution in the presence of an evolving RE population and how to affect it to prevent RE formation and acceleration.

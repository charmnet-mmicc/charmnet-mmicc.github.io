Led by Michigan State University and Los Alamos National Laboratory, CHaRMNET brings together national leaders from seven universities and four DOE national labs in the mathematical modeling of plasmas. The center seeks to build a first-of-its-kind holistic approach that will exploit structure within models to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and to bridge a wide range of length and time scales in plasma science. The curse of dimensionality is a critical challenge that is pervasive throughout computational science and refers to the observation that the resources needed to solve a problem on a computer scale exponentially with the dimension of the problem. Fundamental plasma models are seven-dimensional and are presently computationally intractable (with existing mathematical methods and computational resources) to drive optimization and uncertainty quantification at the engineering scale of plasma systems. Highlights A synergistic theoretical and data-driven approach to hierarchical modeling, including a wide range of surrogates.

In the context of kinetic theory, moment equations offer a natural way to increase fidelity beyond local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) fluid models. Moment equations will be considered in several different ways: (1) as stand-alone models; (2) as members of an adaptive hierarchy; and (3) as components of highly efficient hybrid approaches. At low-order, the behavior of a model depends heavily on the closure assumptions used to derive it. Thus, the design and implementation of the closure is critical. For both fluid and kinetic plasma models, closures determine not just moments of the single-particle distribution function, but also elements of the electromagnetic (EM) field, fluid quantities like electron velocity, and non-gyrotropic parts of particle distribution function. We seek closures that (1) are well-posed; (2) can capture non-equilibrium, non-perturbative effects; (3) preserve important mathematical structures; and (4) are efficient to evaluate. Linear and non-linear surrogates for subgrid modeling and closures We will develop surrogate models for transport and plasmas that naturally tame the CoD by exploiting and preserving underlying structure of the full-order models (FOMs). Within our proposed ecosystem, surrogate models will (1) be physics-preserving (preferably built into mathematical structure of the surrogates, vs. weak enforcement through constraints in the training); (2) be used to accelerate high-performance computing (HPC), e.g., through preconditioning or multi-physics coupling; (3) facilitate multi-scale modeling; and (4) be used in a manner consistent with physics intuition to facilitate physical discovery.

Operator-based surrogates in the CHaRMNET ecosystem should (1) facilitate extraction of mesoscale models from Particle-In-Cell (PIC) or experimental data as stand-alone models or closures for other models and (2) enable the automation of building scale-bridging, interpretable models direct from data. Mesoscale models that capture fine-scale features at lower computational cost are a critical aspect of the proposed ecosystem of CHaRMNET to facilitate UQ, ODC, and HCDM.

The solution space for transport equations coupled to Maxwell\u2019s equations is rugged terrain with significant cliffs, peaks, and valleys that correspond to these many nonlinear transitions (instabilities). Further complicating the design/control process is the fact that the plasma is a dynamical system with rich intermittent and chaotic behaviors, which manifest as an additional source of uncertainty in plasma responses. We need to develop kinetically aware, fast surrogate models for decision and active control in plasma applications. Robustness to CME events could be enhanced if we could make mitigation deployment decisions within the short window of time between the detection of a CME and its arrival at Earth. Of course, such decisions will require quantified confidence levels, since the cost of a mistake could be in the billions of dollars. Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) power-plant concepts currently rely on fast repetition-rate lasers, with target implosions at 1-10 Hz (vs. sub-mHz frequencies of current Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) experiments). Given the need for mass-produced targets, active adjustment of the energy delivery (pulse amplitude, duration, shape, etc.) will be necessary to accommodate defects in the targets, requiring rapid assessment of the implosion efficiency and automated changes in the driver. In Magnetic Fusion Energy (MFE), tokamak detachment and disruption mitigation strategies require active control, especially for the latter, where the disruption can occur on tens of millisecond time scales. Uncontrolled plasma disruptions (and the ensuing generation of fast electrons) can cause reactor damage in the millions of dollars and result in significant down-time, so sophisticated plasma-response surrogates with quantified bias/uncertainty would significantly advance the state of the art in active control for MFE. To focus our efforts, we will consider two target applications with the dual goal of integrating the thrust developments throughout the project, and providing a demonstration test-bed for mathematical breakthroughs. Runaway electrons in MFE Runaway electrons (RE) form as the plasma in a tokamak cools during the thermal quench stage in a disruption due to enhanced plasma resistivity and the corresponding increase of the induced loop voltage. Once they break free from collisional drag, REs become fundamentally kinetic since they cannot be controlled by self-collisional processes. As they accelerate, REs may pick up an increasing fraction of the plasma current, affecting magnetic field evolution. REs are confined by nested flux surfaces in a tokamak and can accelerate to sufficiently large energies to eventually rupture the vacuum wall, which is a key obstacle for the prospects of MFE as an energy source. Understanding RE generation and dynamics is a phenomenal applied mathematics challenge, in principle requiring the integration of the high-dimensional relativistic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation over magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) timescales (much longer than electron collision and transit times). The ultimate goal is to understand magnetic field evolution in the presence of an evolving RE population and how to affect it to prevent RE formation and acceleration. Addressing this challenge will require the tools proposed in CHaRMNET, including hierarchical multiscale methods, data-driven surrogates, and MF approaches for control and UQ (to identify suitable mitigation strategies at the engineering scale).

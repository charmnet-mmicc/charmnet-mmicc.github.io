<a href="https://people.llnl.gov/choi15"><b>Youngsoo Choi</b></a> is a research scientist in Center for Applied Scientific Computing at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. His research focuses on developing efficient data-driven reduced order models for physical simulations for time-sensitive decision-making multi-query problems, such as inverse problems, design optimization, and uncertainty quantification. He is currently leading data-driven reduced order model development team, with whom he developed the open-source code, libROM (https://www.librom.net). libROM is a library for various reduced order modeling capabilities, e.g., physics-constrained projection-based reduced order models, dynamic mode decomposition, and physics-informed latent space dynamics discovery methods. He has earned his undergraduate degree for Civil and Environmental Engineering from Cornell University with applied mathematics as minor and his PhD degree for Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University. He was a postdoc in Sandia National Laboratory and Stanford University prior to joining LLNL in 2017.

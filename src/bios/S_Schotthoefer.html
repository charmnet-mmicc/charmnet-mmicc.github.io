Dr. Steffen Schotth√∂fer is the current Householder Fellow at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He received his Ph.D in Mathematics from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, in May 2023.  His dissertation considers synergies between numerical methods for kinetic equations and neural networks. In 2022 he was a visiting researcher at ORNL. Prior to his PhD, Steffen obtained his Master's Degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from TU Kaiserslautern, Germany, and NTNU Trondheim, Norway in 2020, and his Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering from TU Kaiserslautern in 2017. Steffen's research interests lie in the development of Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation methods for modern, large-scale machine learning and their application as well as data-driven surrogate methods for kinetic equations.

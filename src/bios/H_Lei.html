<b>Huan Lei</b> is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering with a joint position in the Department of Statistics and Probability at Michigan State University. 
He received his Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics from Brown University in 2012. He was a post-doc (2013-2015) and scientist (2015-2019) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and joined Michigan State University in 2019.
His research interest is in applied mathematics and scientific computing, in particular, multi-scale modeling and model reduction with applications to fluid physics, materials science, and biophysics. Currently, his group is devoted to developing data-driven algorithms to learn reliable and physics-interpretable models of meso-scale transport, assembly, and transition processes directly from the micro-scale first-principle-based descriptions. He is an NSF CAREER award receipt (2021).

## Overview


We seek to enable a holistic environment where error estimation and uncertainty quantification (UQ), are used to build trust
in the surrogate models developed in the other thrusts, and where the SP and AP surrogates are also used to
develop new UQ algorithms that can exploit this structure. To enable uncertainty quantification, optimal design/control, optimal design/control under uncertainty, and high-consequence decision-making by high-fidelity transport models and lower-fidelity surrogates, with quantified accuracy, to facilitate the control of materials in extreme conditions and towards the design, optimization, and operation of fusion energy systems.

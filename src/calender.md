Dec 1-2, 2022|  CHaRMNET will have a kick-off team meeting at LANL.  
Nov 14, 2022 |  CHaRMNET team member Luis Chacon (LANL) will present a two-hour seminar to introduce the models and key limits in fusion applications. **Time**: 11:30-1:30 EST.  **Location**: [Zoom link](https://msu.zoom.us/j/94463511260)
Oct 20, 2022 |  DOE is accepting applications for Computational Science Graduate Felloship [CSGF](htpps://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). Established in 1991, the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF) provides outstanding benefits and opportunities to students pursuing doctoral degrees in fields that use high-performance computing to solve complex science and engineering problems.
Sep 26, 2022 | CHaRMNET team members attended [SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/mds22). Dr. David Bortz, Dr. Youngsoo Choi, Dr. John David Jakeman, and Dr. Tim Wildey gave invited talks.  
Aug 22, 2022 | CHaRMNET team member Andrew Christlieb gave a plenary talk at the role of advanced algorithms in understanding plasmas at the International Fusion and Plasma Conference.
Jun 21, 2022 | Congratulations to CHaRMNET member Luis Chacon (LANL) on his [Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award](https://science.osti.gov/lawrence). The EO Lawrence award is DOEâ€™s highest honor for mid-career scientists. He was awarded "for seminal contributions in multiscale algorithms for fluid, kinetic, and hybrid simulation of plasmas, enabling scientific breakthroughs in fast magnetic reconnection and self-organization in magnetic fusion systems, and in reactivity degradation in inertial fusion systems".

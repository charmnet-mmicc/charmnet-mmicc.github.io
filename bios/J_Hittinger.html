<a href="https://people.llnl.gov/hittinger1"><b>Jeff Hittinger</b></a> is the Director of the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the nexus of research in computational mathematics, computer science, and data science in the Computation Directorate. Prior to this, he was the Group Leader for and a Computational Scientist in the Scientific Computing Group in CASC. Jeff works primarily on the application of advanced discretization methods and techniques to plasma physics simulation, and he led LLNLâ€™s Variable Precision Computing Strategic Initiative project. His research interests include computational plasma physics, computational fluid dynamics, higher-order finite-difference and finite-volume methods, parallel computing, adaptive mesh refinement, error estimation, and variable precision computing. 
Jeff joined CASC in October 2000 as a postdoctoral researcher. Prior to this, he attended the <a href="https://umich.edu/"> University of Michigan </a> where he received his Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering and Scientific Computing (2000), his M.S. in Mathematics (1997), and his M.S.E. in Aerospace Engineering (1994). Jeff received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Lehigh University (1993).

<a href="https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/cory-d-hauck"><b>Cory Hauck </b></a> is an applied mathematician and group leader of the <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/group/multiscale-methods"> Multiscale Methods and Dynamics Group </a> at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  He received his Ph.D in <a href="https://amsc.umd.edu/"> Applied Mathematics from the University of Maryland </a> in 2006, and before coming to Oak Ridge, sat in the <a href="https://cnls.lanl.gov/External/">Center for Nonlinear Studies </a> at Los Alamos National Laboratory as a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/computer-computational-statistical-sciences/computational-physics-methods/index.php"> Computational Physics and Methods Group </a>.
Dr. Hauck is interested in various aspects of numerical analysis, computational physics, scientific computing, and mathematical tools for scientific data.  His primary research area is the development of numerical methods for kinetic equations and related models.  These models are characteristic by multiscale phenomena, and their simulation requires advanced mathematical tools in modeling and computation.

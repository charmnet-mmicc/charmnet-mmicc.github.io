 <a href="https://cmse.msu.edu/directory/faculty/andrew-christlieb/"><b>Andrew Christlieb</b></a> currently serves as the Director of the Center for Hierarchical and Robust Modeling of Non-Equilibrium Transport (CHaRMNET), one of four Department of Energy Mathematical Multifaceted Integrated Capability Centers.  In 2001, he received his PhD in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin. After completing two post-docs at the University of Michigan (one in aerospace and one in mathematics), in 2006 he began his career at Michigan State University.  In 2007,  He was recognized by the Young Investigator Program (YIP) of the Air Force Office Of Scientific Research.  From 2007-2011 he was an Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) with Kirtland Air Force Base. His core research interests are scalable implicit algorithms, high-order structure/asymptotic preserving methods for both kinetic and fluid models, fast integral equations methods, particle methods, blended computing paradigms, and structure-preserving machine learning. His group has been recognized by the National Science Foundation, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Office of Navel Research, and the Department of Energy for their work on high order methods and novel approaches to multi-scale problems in plasma and material science.  Dr. Christlieb has graduated 22 PhD students and mentored 17 post-docs who have gone on to positions in industry, universities and the national labs. He is currently a University Foundation Professor of Mathematics at Michigan State University and from 2015-2021, Dr. Christlieb served as the founding chair of the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering at Michigan State University.

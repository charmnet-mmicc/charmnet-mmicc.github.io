<a href="https://sigalgottlieb.sites.umassd.edu/"><b>Sigal Gottlieb</b></a> received her Ph.D. from Brown University in 1998 and in 1999 joined the  Mathematics Department at UMass Dartmouth, where she us currently Chancellor Professor in the mathematics department.  Professor Gottlieb is known internationally as an expert in strong-stability-preserving time discretizations and other schemes for hyperbolic equations. She has published two books and over 40 research papers in peer-reviewed journals of high caliber. Her papers have over 8000 citations, with her top two papers having over 2300 citations each.  Her area of research is in computational and applied mathematics, and her work has been continually funded by the  Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  She is a Fellow of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics  and of the Association for Women in Mathematics. For four years (2017-2021) Professor Gottlieb was a Deputy Director at the NSF funded Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM).
Dr. Gottlieb is founding director of the Center for Scientific Computing and Data Science Research, the hub for computational science research at UMassD and aims to support faculty doing computational research at UMassD, and promote internationally-recognized computational research  that advances the fields of modern applied science, data-driven and data science algorithms. She has led several successful equipment proposals for large-scale computing clusters that support the research of CSCDR affiliates. In related activities, she was instrumental  in the development of new academic programs, including the EAS  doctoral program and the Data Science BS and MS programs.

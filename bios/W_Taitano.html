<a href="https://laro.lanl.gov/esploro/profile/william_taitano_1/output/all?institution=01LANL_INST"><b>William T. Taitano</b></a> is a staff scientist in the T-5 Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group within the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). As a computational physicist, he develops holistic computational frameworks to address the multiscale and multiphysics complexities inherent in kinetic equations, with a focus on high energy density (HED) systems such as the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) application. His research interests include advanced solvers, mesh adaptivity, and discrete symmetry-preserving discretizations, all aimed at enabling high-fidelity kinetic modeling of complex HED experiments. He is one of the primary developers of the coupled radiation and Vlasov-Fokker-Planck spherical implosion code, iFP, supporting users at both LANL, MIT, and University of Rochester. He is a recipient of the 2025 DOE Early Career Award (ECRP).

<a href="https://jingmeiqiu.github.io/"><b>Jingmei Qiu</b></a> is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Delaware. Her general area of research is numerical analysis and scientific computing. Her specialty area is in the design, analysis and application of high order structure preserving computational algorithms, for complex systems that involve multi-scale and multi-physics features and are of high dimensional nature. She has been working on high order numerical methods for fluid, kinetic and multi-scale models. Recently she is interested in Eulerian-Lagrangian high order approaches, and low rank approximations to high dimensional nonlinear dynamics. Her methodology has been applied to astronomy, physics, and engineering problems.

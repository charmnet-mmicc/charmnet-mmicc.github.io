<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yingda-cheng"><b>Yingda Cheng</b></a> is a Professor at Michigan State University. Her specialty is in numerical methods of PDEs, in particular, discontinuous Galerkin methods and deterministic kinetic simulations. Recently, her group is devoted to developing reduced order models for complex kinetic transport using tools from machine learning, reduced order modeling and sparse grid techniques. Dr. Cheng received her B.S. degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2003, and Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics from Brown University in 2007. She was a postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin from 2007 to 2011. She joined MSU in 2011, and has been assistant (2011-2016), associate (2016-2021) and full (2021-) professor in mathematics and Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE). She is a NSF CAREER award receipt (2015) and Simons Fellow in Mathematics (2018).
